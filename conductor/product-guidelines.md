# Product Guidelines - Atelier Notes

## Voice and Tone
*   **Friendly and Encouraging:** Atelier Notes should interact with the user like a helpful assistant. The tone should be welcoming and supportive, rather than strictly clinical or technical.
*   **Conversational but Competent:** While the language is more relaxed, it must always convey expertise and reliability.

## Interaction Principles
*   **Proactive Guidance:** The tool should go beyond just executing commands; it should proactively offer suggestions or tips based on user patterns to help them get the most out of their knowledge base.
*   **Helpful Assistant Persona:** Interactions should feel collaborative. For example, when suggesting a new category for a note, it could explain *why* it made that suggestion.

## Visual Identity (CLI)
*   **Rich and Engaging Output:** The CLI should utilize terminal capabilities like colors and bold text to categorize information and highlight important details (e.g., search scores, metadata tags).
*   **Expressive with Emojis:** Subtle use of emojis can be employed to add personality and provide quick visual cues for different types of actions or results.
*   **Readability First:** Despite the rich formatting, the primary goal remains clarity and ease of scanning information.
*   **Machine-Readable Support:** For integration with external tools like Neovim plugins, the CLI must support machine-readable output formats (e.g., JSON) for relevant commands to facilitate the creation of custom UIs and automated workflows.
