# Product Guide - Atelier Notes

## Initial Concept
Atelier Notes is a CLI tool designed to manage an AI-enhanced knowledge base. It facilitates note creation, organization, and retrieval using a flat file structure and semantic search capabilities.

## Target Audience
The primary audience for Atelier Notes consists of individual developers and power users. These users typically manage their notes in Markdown and prefer command-line interfaces for their speed and integration with other developer tools.

## Core Goals
*   **AI-Enhanced Intelligence:** Atelier Notes aims to transform a passive collection of text files into an active knowledge base by providing semantic search and AI-assisted organization, making information retrieval effortless.
*   **Workflow Friction Reduction:** The tool is designed to provide a fast CLI interface that bridges the gap between various capture methods, such as Neovim on desktop and Google Keep on mobile, and the local flat-file storage.

## Critical Features
*   **Advanced Retrieval:** Robust semantic search capabilities powered by the Gemini CLI to find notes based on meaning rather than just keywords.
*   **Seamless Capture:** High-fidelity integration between mobile capture (Google Keep), desktop editing (Neovim), and the local filesystem.
*   **Automated Organization:** AI-driven agents that automatically manage metadata and file structure, ensuring the knowledge base remains organized without manual effort.

## User Experience (UX) Philosophy
*   **Speed and Efficiency:** Atelier Notes prioritizes near-instantaneous, keyboard-centric operations to maintain user flow.
*   **Transparency:** All AI-driven modifications to notes, including metadata updates and file reorganization, must be visible to the user and easily reversible to ensure trust and control.
